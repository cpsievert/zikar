# zikar

An R package for exploring publicly available Zika data. 
Currently, it provides easy access to data in [this repository](https://github.com/cdcepi/zika), and a shiny app to explore it.

## Installation

This package is not on CRAN, but you can install via devtools with:

```{r, eval= FALSE}
devtools::install_github("cpsievert/zikar")
```

## Getting Started

Currently there is really only one dataset of interest

```{r}
library(zikar)
zika
```

By calling `explore()`, a shiny app for exploring this data is invoked.
